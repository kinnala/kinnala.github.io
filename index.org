* Introduction

I'm an applied mathematician focusing on numerical methods and scientific
computing.  I'm currently employed by [[http://math.aalto.fi/en/][Aalto University, Department of
Mathematics and Systems Analysis]] as a postdoctoral researcher, working in the
Academy of Finland project [[https://akareport.aka.fi/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=x_HakKuvaus2&CLICKED_ON=&HAKNRO1=324611&UILANG=fi&TULOSTE=HTML][Effektiva finita element metoder inom
kontinuummekanik]], 2019--22.

* Research

In 2018, I [[https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=255380][finished my D.Sc. dissertation]] on [[https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/31486][Finite Element Methods for Contact
Problems]] which was funded mainly by the [[https://skr.fi/][Finnish Cultural Foundation]].  You can
find my articles in [[https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1611-5032][Orcid]] and [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1NxplQcAAAAJ][Google Scholar]].  I often upload preprints to
[[https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0003-1611-5032.html][arXiv]].

* Software

In 2017â€“18, I wrote an open source Python package for finite element
assembly called [[https://github.com/kinnala/scikit-fem][scikit-fem]]. I still maintain and use it actively, and think its
especially useful for learning about finite element methods and performing
computational research.  You can find examples from its [[https://kinnala.github.io/scikit-fem-docs][documentation]].

* Peer reviews

In the past, I have volunteered to work as a peer reviewer for the following
scientific journals:

- [[https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mms][Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids]], 2020
- [[https://www.esaim-m2an.org/][ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis]], 2020
- [[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rspa][Proceedings of the Royal Society A]], 2020
- [[https://www.springer.com/journal/10543][BIT Numerical Mathematics]], 2020
- [[https://www.degruyter.com/cmam][Computational Methods in Applied Mathematics]], 2018
- [[https://rakenteidenmekaniikka.journal.fi/][Rakenteiden Mekaniikka]], 2018, 2017
- [[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-mathematics-and-computation][Applied Mathematics and Computation]], 2015

* Reverse acknowledgements

Here are some interesting references to my work:

- In 2019, a research group at the University of Oxford used my finite element
  libary in their [[https://doi.org/10.1149/osf.io/67ckj][tool for the mathematical modelling of batteries]].

- In 2019, I was [[https://doi.org/10.3390/fluids4020098][acknowledged by Portuguese colleagues]] after discussions on
  the implementation of numerical solvers for piezoviscous Reynolds equation.

- In 2018, I received an [[https://into.aalto.fi/display/endoctoralsci/Dissertation+awards][award for an exceptionally distinguished D. Sc. dissertation]].

- In 2017, I helped a colleague (and a friend) in the implementation of a finite
  element solver and, as a consequence, [[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5000908][was acknowledged in the related
  scientific article]].

- In 2014, I received an [[http://rmseura.tkk.fi/rmlehti/palkitut_artikkelit.html][article of the year award]] for my first ever scientific
  publication.
